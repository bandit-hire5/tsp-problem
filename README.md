## Classic traveling salesman problem

A greedy algorithm is used to solve the problem.

### Greedy algorithm

When next point is choosing, the nearest point is taken in which we have not been.
For this algorithm it is very important which point is chosen as the starting. So it needs to make each point a starting and choose the option that will give the shortest path.

### How to use?

Run with 12 points: 
```bash
npm start input1.txt
```

Run with 100 points:
```bash
npm start input2.txt
```

Run with 200 points:
```bash
npm start input3.txt
```
